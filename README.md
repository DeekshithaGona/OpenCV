# OpenCV
This repo consists of few exercises, projects, tasks related to Image Processing, Computer Vision using OpenCV. Check it out.


# GAMING using handgestures 
With this setup, you can potentially play games that involve left and right movement, navigation, or simple controls.

# Image Registration
Image registration is the process of aligning two or more images of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, or with different sensors. It's vital in medical imaging, satellite imagery, and computer vision for tasks like change detection, object tracking, and fusing data for enhanced analysis and visualization.


# SoundandBrightnessControl Using HandGestures
Control your system's audio volume and screen brightness using hand gestures. This project uses the Mediapipe library for real-time hand tracking, OpenCV for image processing, and external libraries for interacting with system settings.  It can adjust volume, control brightness. A peace sign gesture toggles between modes. Windows OS is required due to API dependencies.
